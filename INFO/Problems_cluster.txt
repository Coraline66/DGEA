This is a good thing to learn. You can install local copies of packages for personal use. 

Look at:

The computation cannot be proceeded on the cluster since there are no
packages “DESeq2” and  “edgeR” in the library. I have obtained most of the
results from local and I am modifying the table and plots.

Thanks for your time.

For now until I sort this out switch from R-markdown to plain R on the
cluster machines. What you can do is do the compute heavy stuff on the
cluster in pure R and then write the data to an R-file and complete the
report on your laptop with R mark down.

I will see if we can get Pandoc installed in the meantime.

The output of “which R” is:

/opt/common/CentOS_6-dev/R/R-3.3.1_v2/bin/R


I found that the “rmarkdown” package in this version of R but “render”
cannot be used to generate files since there exists no pandoc or its
version is not high enough. Here is the error message:

Error: pandoc version 1.12.3 or higher is required and was not found
(see
the help page ?rmarkdown::pandoc_available).


Thank you for your time.

Can you give me the path to the R you are using on the cluster. To find
this out log into the cluster server and type

which R

You should something like:

$ which R
/opt/common/CentOS_6-dev/bin/current/R
$

Send me that output. Again do it on the cluster machine not your mac
laptop

The output is as follows:

I am using version 3.3.1, however the latest version I found on the
cluster is 3.2.0.

Thank you for your time.

We have several version of R on the cluster. Can you do:

R --version

and send me the output so I can see what version you are using and
then
other point you to a different one or install R markdown on that one.

Dear Dr. Socci,

Rmarkdown files(.rmd) couldn¹t be run via cluster since there is no
Œrmarkdown¹ package. Could you help me with this problem?
Thank you so much for your time.
