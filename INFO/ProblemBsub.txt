Dear Dr. Socci,

Sorry for the late reply. 
I didn’t specify the core setting “-n 32” and I will modify my commands and resubmit my jobs later.

Thank you for your time.

Regards,
Coraline

Coraline,

What is the bsub command you are giving when you run your jobs?

Are us specifying the core setting 

-n 32

you need to do that as your jobs are overloading the cluster. Please stop them and resubmit with 

-n 32
