Title: Plots using new truth sets

Dear Dr. Socci,

Please see the data(new truth sets, TPR and PPV) for the plots in the attachment. The indices such as “fdr48_de33_1” represent the case wise FDR values for the first iteration, i.e., fdr48_de33_1[1:33] are the FDR values for the first iteration when n_sample = 3 and fdr48_de33_1[34:66] are the FDR values for the first iteration when n_sample = 4, etc., fdr48_de33_1[331:363] are the FDR values for the first iteration when n_sample = 45. 

I am currently working on the case of 100 iterations for both LUAD and BRCA and hopefully I could get the results soon.

Thanks for your time.

Regards,
Coraline

Can you send me the data for the plots. I would like to try playing around with the way it is plotted. 

thanks

Dear Dr. Socci,

Good morning.
Attached are the plots of TPR and PPV for truth set 48 patients, 33 iterations and in 100% gene lists. It is nice that higher values and increasing patterns  can be seen from the new plots. Most ppv curves for edgeR surpass 0.9 in the end. 
May I perform the analysis with a larger iteration number(100) next? Or should I also try several different combinations of truth sets and apply these to BRCA data?

Thank you for your time.
