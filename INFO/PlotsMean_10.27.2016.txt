Dear Dr. Socci,

Good afternoon.
Attached are the plots of TPR and PPV for deseq2 and edger without error bars. It can be seen that TPR shows remarkably high values for TS(48/1000/100)_ LUAD by both deseq2 and edger, where TS represents Truth Set. The lowest curve of TPR is given by either TS(54/100/90) or TS(54/1000/90). A similar result can also be derived for BRCA. On the contrary, we obtain a completely opposite conclusion for PPV. The highest curve of PPV is shown by either TS(54/100/90) or TS(54/1000/90), while the lowest curve arises from TS(48/1000/100). 

Thank you for your time.

Regards,
Coraline
