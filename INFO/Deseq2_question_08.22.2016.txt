You left off an underscore (_) in

You wrote:

	ddsHTSeq_fil$condition <- factor(ddsHTSeq_fil$condition,
        			                          levels=c("normal","tumor²))

But it should be
	dds_HTSeq_fil$condition <- factor(dds_HTSeq_fil$condition,
        				                          levels=c("normal","tumor²))

Dear Dr. Socci,
Please see the r code with six htseq-counts data in the attachment.
In the file ³deseq_02², an error occurs when I try to use ³DESeq²
function on the dataset ³ddsHTSeq_fil². Here is the error:
"Error in designAndArgChecker(object, betaPrior) :  variables in the
design formula cannot have NA values².
By comparing the dataset before and after resetting its levels, I found
that the "condition"(colData names of the dataset) before resetting
factor levels was:
[1] Normal_01 Normal_02 Normal_03 Tumor_01  Tumor_02  Tumor_03
Levels: Normal_01 Normal_02 Normal_03 Tumor_01 Tumor_02 Tumor_03
while that after resetting factor levels was:
[1] <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA> <NA>
Levels: normal tumor
It seems that the function "DESeq" does not work unless those "NA's"
are removed. Therefore, I modified my code in file ³deseq_01². The
differential analysis can be proceeded this time but I am not sure
whether this is the correct way to define the factor levels. Could you
give me some advice on this problem?
Thank you for your time.
Regards,
Coraline
