Dear Dr. Socci,

Attached is a brief r-code of the differential gene analysis of 100 patients(brca) in case you would like to see the updated version. I didnâ€™t create a rmarkdown file because the code was splitted into several parts and run on cluster and it would be very time consuming to generate rmarkdown files. 

Thank you for your time.

Regards, 
Coraline
