Title: Questions about extracting data from TCGA

Because most of the samples have only one htseq counts file which corresponds to tumor. Only a few of them have a control group with counts of normal tissue. I will use the 57 samples of luad then.

Thanks for your time.

The htseq-counts files(tumor vs normal) for TCGA-LUAD and TCGA-OV are not enough to obtain 100 samples. The maximum for luad is 57 and the number for ov is even smaller.

Is that because there are two few normals?? If so go with 50 samples or as many as possible
