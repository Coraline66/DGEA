Thank you for your time.

 {During the analysis of tcga-brca, I use the same seed in both generating new truth sets and performing differential expression analysis for each case. Does it have any effect on the final result? Should I change to two different seeds?}


Not sure but I would use two different seeds in this case. In fact unless you are debugging you should always use a different seed whenever you are calling the seed function. Something based on DATE/TIME so it is never the same.
