Dear Dr. Socci,

Please see the integrated counts matrix in the attachment. I am trying to debug the code to figure out where the problem is.

Thank you for your time and have a nice weekend.

Dear Dr. Socci,

Good morning.
The integrated data for 50 patients(brca) and 57 patients(luan) can be found in the attachment. The number of desired files for tcga-ov are too small(< 10) and not enough for our analysis. I haven’t got the final result for 100 patients(brca) since the runtime is much longer than I expected. In order to prepare for the further analysis, could you please check the data to see whether all the information needed for the next stage is included?  Additionally, what do I need to prepare and learn for the next step? I checked some basic information about “Gene set enrichment analysis” but I’m not sure if this will help.

Thank you for your time.

Regards,

Dear Dr. Socci,

Attached is the integrated data for 100 patients(brca). Could you tell me what I should prepare for the next step in advance if the data contains everything needed in the next stage? By the way, since the data was saved via “saveRDS”, it has to be loaded via “readRDS”.

Thank you for your time

Regards,
Coraline
