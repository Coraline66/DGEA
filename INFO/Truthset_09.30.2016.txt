So all the emails that you send me you should compile into one document called INFO or README and put that on the github site so I can go back to refer to them. 

thanks

Dear Dr. Socci,

Please see the information of the new “Truth Set” in the attachment. 95 samples were generated 100 times randomly. There are 7875(78.9% of the “Truth Set”(No.1)) and 8849(67.8% of the “Truth Set”(No.1)) genes in the “Truth Set”(No.2) for deseq2 and edger, respectively. Information about “Truth Set”(90/100) and “Truth Set”(80/100) are also listed in the file. Is it reasonable to use this “Truth Set”(No.2) as our new “Truth Set”?
By the way, the file can be loaded by using “readRDS()” since it was saved via “saveRDS()”. “load()” might not work for this file.

Thank you for your time.
