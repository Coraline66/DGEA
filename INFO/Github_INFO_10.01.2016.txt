Dear Dr. Socci,

I have uploaded all relative emails with corresponding titles in a file called “INFO” to my github repository “DGEA”.  Here is the link to “INFO”:
https://github.com/Coraline66/DGEA/tree/master/INFO

The R code and Rmarkdown files will also be uploaded as soon as I finish compiling them.
Have a nice weekend.

Regards,
Coraline
