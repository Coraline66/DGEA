Dear Dr. Socci,

I tried to download TCGA data from TCGA Data Portal but it is no longer available and an alternative link is provided as : https://gdc.nci.nih.gov. However, I canâ€™t figure out which data is level 2 from this new website. Could you help me with this problem? 

Thank you.

Coraline
