Okay, then I will reset the TPR’s and PPV’s for this case.

Thanks for your time.

There is a problem when I tried to perform the differential analysis to TCGA-BRCA data. Some gene lists are empty after filtering with P_adj < 0.05 and | log_2 FC | > 1 when the sample number n=3. In this case, the corresponding TPR values are all zero and there exist no PPV. Should I remove these empty gene lists to proceed the analysis?

No. That is one of the effects we want to see. That at too low replicates you might actually get nothing. For those cases set TPR=0 and PPV=0
