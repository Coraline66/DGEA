Dear Dr. Socci,

Please find the roc plots and boxplots of ppv and sensitivity for deseq2 and edger in the attachment. 
As for the roc plots, to make it easier for comparing each case(n= 3, 4, etc.), I stretch y-axis so that the points do not overlap. It seems that deseq2 provides a more accurate result with lower FDR when n is large, while edger provides a safer result with higher PPV when n is small.
To be on the safe side, the original FDR and TPR data are also included in the file. 

Thank you for your time.

Regards,
Coraline
