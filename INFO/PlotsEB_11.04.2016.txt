I would really appreciate it if you install the following packages for
version R-3.2.2:

DESeq2
edgeR
Biobase
Parallel

Thank you for your time and have a nice weekend.

Dear Dr. Socci,

Okay, I will convert the plots and try another version of R.
Thanks for your time

Also can you break the plot up to one per page. Use the PDF format to create a multipage PDF.

Dear Dr. Socci,
Good afternoon.
Please see the plots with error bars of TPR and PPV in the attachment.
I used two ways(standard deviation and standard error) to display the
error bars.
During the process of TCGA-SARC analysis, the number of patients
decreases from 164 to 162 since two of them don¹t have htseq-counts
files. I haven¹t finished the differential expression analysis of SARC
as my jobs are no longer able to run on the cluster. The command I used
is shown as:

bsub -J SARC49_1 -oo SARC49_1.stdout -eo SARC49_1.stderr -cwd
/ifs/work/qux1/SARC -M 60 -n 10
"/opt/common/CentOS_6-dev/R/R-3.3.1_v2/bin/Rscript --vanilla
/ifs/work/qux1/SARC/sarc49_1.R"

Error is shown as:

/opt/common/CentOS_6-dev/R/R-3.3.1/lib64/R/bin/R: line 238:
/opt/common/CentOS_6-dev/R/R-3.3.1_v2/lib64/R/etc/CC???2/ldpaths:
Input/output error

When I entered the directory
³/opt/common/CentOS_6-dev/R/R-3.3.1_v2/bin², I found that files ³R² and
³Rscript² were modified by user ³kandoth² on Oct 27. I think these
changes might be the reason for my problem. Could you tell me how I
should modify my code regarding these changes?

Thank you so much for your time.

Coraline
